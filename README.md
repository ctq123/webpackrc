# Use antd in create-react-app

## Step by Step Documentation

- English: https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app
- 中文：https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app-cn

⚠️ [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) which is used to configure create-react-app and avoid to eject, is no more maintained and doesn't officialy support create-react-app 2.X (notably some plugins may break due to changes in webpack, see https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/issues/162). However, it works with CRA 2.1.1, ant-design and react-app-rewire-less and thus you can still use it (at your own risk) .

## Preview

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

or:
